## 8 Puzzle Problem using Depth-First Search (DFS)
This Python script solves the classic 8-puzzle problem using Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm.

Description
The 8-puzzle problem is a popular puzzle in artificial intelligence that involves sliding tiles on a 3x3 grid to reach a desired configuration. The goal is to arrange the tiles in ascending order, with the blank space at the bottom-right corner. The puzzle is solved when all tiles are in their correct positions.

This implementation uses Depth-First Search algorithm to search for the solution. DFS explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. It maintains a stack of unexplored nodes and explores the deepest unexplored node first.

Features
Accepts user-defined initial state for the puzzle.
Utilizes Depth-First Search algorithm to find the solution.
Outputs the sequence of moves required to solve the puzzle.
